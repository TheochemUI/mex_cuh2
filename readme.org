* About
A lot of inherited code unfortunately uses MATLAB. File I/O interfaces are
horrible. This has a slightly less horrible implementation. The C-Fortran
interface is tested in ~potlib~ anyway, so only the bindings need to be checked
here.
** Usage

#+begin_src bash
mex eam_wrap_mex.c eam_isoc.f90 eamroutines.f90
#+end_src

I find it easier to work in ~C~ for the interface to MATLAB.
