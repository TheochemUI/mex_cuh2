* About
A lot of inherited code unfortunately uses MATLAB. File I/O interfaces
are horrible. This has a slightly less horrible implementation (still
MATLAB though).
** Usage

#+begin_src bash
mex eam_wrap_mex.c eam_isoc.f90 eamroutines.f90
#+end_src

I find it easier to work in ~C~ for the interface to MATLAB.
